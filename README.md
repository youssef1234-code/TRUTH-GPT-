# TRUTH-GPT
This webapp is a question-answering system that uses an AI model to respond to user queries. It is built using Node.js, JavaScript, and Vite, allowing for a fast and efficient response time. The AI model is trained to understand natural language and provide accurate answers to user questions. This webapp can be used
in a variety of contexts, such as customer service, education, and research.
NodeJs , Express , javascript and OpenAi Api were used . Same idea as chatGpt but simpler 

N.B : It still doesnot have a memory or questions u have asked before
